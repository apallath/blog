I finally had the chance to implement Deep Dream (using the pre-trained Inception v3
neural network) as a part of my deep learning
journey. It is hard to find the time to code up algorithms that
aren't related to my research, but the stunning visuals that
this produced were very rewarding.

Here are some cool images I managed to make:

Finally, my personal favorite, this post's Hero image:

Check out the [code](https://github.com/apallath/generative_art) I used to make these images on Github.
