I finally had the chance to implement Deep Dream as a part of my deep learning
journey. It's hard to find the time to code up computer vision algorithms that
aren't related to my research, but the stunning (albeit low-res) visuals that
this produced were rewarding.

Here are some cool images I managed to make.
